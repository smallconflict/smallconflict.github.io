		  			<h3>How Do You Get Amped?</h3>
		  			<p>Until the 1950s, tubes ruled the day. The vacuum tube gave rise to everything from radios to TV. Digital technology has replaced the part almost everywhere, but one stronghold remains. Musicians are keeping the tube alive, preferring its colorful sound in amps to the flatter, solid-state technology.</p>

		  			<h3>When A Grocery Store Leaves The Neighborhood</h3>
		  			<p>In October 2013, Safeway Inc. announced it would be closing all of its Chicago-area Dominick's. While most of the shuttered locations have found a solution for their would-be empty lots, one Evanston neighborhood faces a still uncertain future, left without a grocer or effecient means to access one.</p>

		  			<p>Banning books is nothing new, but social media provides a loud, public platform for those on both sides of the issue. With the help of digital tools, what used to be a small, schoolground battle over banning books in curriculum now takes a national stage.</p>

		  			<h3>Coping Mechanisms</h3>
		  			<p>It's a relationship so fraught with danger that it's regulated by local governments--landlords and tenants. One side attempts to turn a profit and protect itself from potential liability or damages; the other seeks a safe place to live, sometimes with disregard to maintaining the property as an invested owner might. Both have developed  creative coping mechanisms to come out on top.</p>

		  		<div class="col-md-3">
		  			<br>
		  			<p>Advanced Interactive Storytelling and Design explores interactive storytelling from the ground up--from story inception through reporting, designing a narrative construction, production, and publication.</p> 
		  			<p>The "Unclass" applies a human-centered design approach directly to the classroom, ditching a one-size-fits-all syllabus in favor of student-centered, project-focused work. Instructors provide the structure and context through more than 50 opt-in workshops; students mapped their own path through the course. </p>
